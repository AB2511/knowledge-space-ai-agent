# Knowledge Space AI Agent

## Overview
This project builds an AI-powered agent inspired by KnowledgeSpace, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer neuroscience-related queries. It features a React frontend (chatbot UI), Node.js backend, and a Python-based RAG pipeline with local document retrieval.

## Goals
- Create a Q&A system for neuroscience data.
- Use RAG to combine retrieval (documents) and generation (LLM).
- Deploy locally, with plans for ElasticSearch and GCP.

## Structure
- `/frontend`: React-based chatbot interface.
- `/backend`: Node.js API to connect frontend and AI.
- `/ai_pipeline`: Python scripts for RAG (retrieval + generation).

## Tech Stack
- Python, LangChain, Sentence-Transformers
- Node.js, Express, React
- Future: ElasticSearch, Neo4j, GCP

## Progress
- [ ] Set up repo and environment (April 2025)
- [ ] Build RAG pipeline
- [ ] Integrate backend and frontend
